## Backend

This folder currently holds backend-related documentation and setup guides:

- `README-Backend.md`: Overview of the planned/real backend and endpoints
- Firebase and Firestore setup docs
- Stripe and roadmap presentations

There is no server code here yet. When you add a backend (e.g., Node/Express), place it in this folder (e.g., `backend/server.js`, `backend/routes/`, etc.).

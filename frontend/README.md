## Frontend

This folder contains the static website for EggPrices NZ:

- Open `index.html` in your browser to launch the app.
- All client-side JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the `slideshow/` demo live here.
- If deploying on Netlify, the `netlify.toml` here configures redirects and headers.

Nothing in this folder requires a backend to run. API calls (if any) are proxied per `netlify.toml`.
